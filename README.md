Basics of Social Network Analysis

Some concepts and terminologies required to perform a social network analysis:
1. A network is represented as graph, which shows links between each vertex(or node) and its neighbours.
2. A line indicating a link between vertices is called a edge.
3. A group of vertices that are mutually reachable by following edges on the graph is called a component.
4. The edges on the graph is called a component.
5. The edged followed from one node to another are called a path. 

Kinds of graphs:
1. Undirected Graph: An undirected graph is graph, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are bidirectional.
2. Directed Graph: A directed graph is graph, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another.

Measurements of vertex(or node):
1. Vertex Density = No. of connections divided by total possible connections 
2. Vertex Degree = No. of links from each vertex
3. Clique = A group of vertices where all the possible links are present
